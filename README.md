## Introduction to CI/CD
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices designed to automate the process of software development, testing, and deployment. CI involves the frequent integration of code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated testing to detect integration issues early. CD extends CI by automatically deploying code changes to various environments once they pass the CI process, reducing manual intervention and streamlining deployments​​.

## Key Concepts:
### Continuous Integration (CI)
* Frequent Integration: Developers integrate code changes multiple times a day into a shared repository.
* Automated Testing: Each integration triggers automated builds and tests to detect errors early, improving software quality.
* Early Detection of Issues: Enables quick identification and resolution of integration problems​​.

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
* Automatic Deployment: Code changes are automatically deployed to development, staging, and production environments.
* Reduced Manual Intervention: Streamlines the deployment process, making it faster and less error-prone.
* Consistency: Ensures that deployments are consistent across all environments​​.

### Benefits of CI/CD:
- Improved Code Quality: Automated testing ensures that new code integrates smoothly with the existing codebase, reducing bugs and errors.
- Faster Releases: Automation of the build, test, and deployment processes speeds up the release cycle.
- Early Problem Detection: Continuous integration helps detect issues early in the development process, making them easier and cheaper to fix.
- Enhanced Collaboration: Encourages collaboration among developers by integrating changes frequently, reducing merge conflicts.
- Consistent Environments: Automated deployments ensure that applications run consistently across different environments​​.
